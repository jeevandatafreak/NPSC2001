#Data Visualisation



```{r}
plot_boxplot(clinical_data, "PAM50.mRNA")

#This boxplot demonstrates the spread of values across different variables according to the subtype. The values here are of not much use, but we can see that age of diagnosis is earlier for basal-like while luminal and HER2-enriched cancer types have a similar mean and inter-quartile range.
```
```{r}
clinical_data %>% ggplot(aes(x = PAM50.mRNA, y = Age.at.Initial.Pathologic.Diagnosis, colour = PAM50.mRNA)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Cancer Subtype", y = "Diagnosis Age", title = "Boxplot of Cancer Subtypes by Diagnosis Age")+
 scale_fill_brewer(palette="RdPu") + theme_bw()

#The boxplot confirms fair similarity within the subtypes. Through boxplots we can generate a lot of detail regarding what the data offers. Each section of the box and whisker plot displays 25% of the data, the whiskers being the lines at the end and the box being the white-space contained within the whiskers. Within the box is one distinct line that represents the median of values. Hence, the lines at the lower and upper end of the box are considered inter-quartile ranges, from 25% to 75%, thus 50% of the values are represented within the box and the other 50 within the whiskers. 

#We can determine that he HER2-enriched cancer exression within the dataset is relatively normally distributed, hence why the median is near the middle of the box (assume middle of box is mean as it's directly between 25% and 75%). However, Luminal subtypes both appear to be right skewed, indicating that most cases will have a higher diagnosis age on average. Basal-like, however, is left-skewed, indicating a lower diagnosis age. This can imply the notion that premenopausal cancers are more likely to be Basal-like

#This visualisation indicates that determining cancer subtypes and proteomic expressions are essential, as it may lead to earlier diagnosis for basal-like subtype patients, not dependent on the overall diagnosis age of all other subtypes. 

#Let's determine if cancer stages provide a similar insight. Stages and subtypes differ in that stages show the development of cancer while subtypes (PAM50.mRNA) reflect the proteomic expression of the cancer. They are entirely different, but could be correlated.
```

  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust = 1)) + scale_fill_brewer(palette="RdPu") + theme_bw()

#There is much more variation within the cancer stages. Stage 1 cancers can be identified much later throughout life, but stage 2 and stage 3 cancers are relatively found and middle-age period (50-65). Stage 4 however appears to have a diagnosis at a later age too. Considering the wide spread of the data and small sample within the dataset, it's impossible to consider any insights by this visualisation alone. A much better insight could be gathered within a dataset of 10000 samples rather than the 108 that we currently have. However, due to data access limitations and processing power, this may not be reproduced effectively.

  labs(x = "Progesterone Status", y = "Diagnosis Age", title = "Boxplot of Progesterone by Diagnosis Age") 


#Estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) are hormones, however hormones can have huge influence on cancer diagnosis. We can determine through both boxplots that their distributions are extremely similar. Both ER and PR negative status samples contain a left skew and overall lower distribution than the positive status samples. This could imply that hormones may play a part in 'delaying' the diagnosis of cancer within patients. Considering, however, that our focus lies mainly within subtypes, this does not tell us much in regards to proteomic prediction (predicting the cancer by protein expression).

#Most patients appear to be stage 2 cancer patients. This isn't abnormal, we would not expect many stage 4 and we would assume that most patients would be split in either stage 1 and stage 2. In this specific dataset, most individuals are stage 2. The fill of the graph simply indicates that the stage classification of AJCC (it's a more complex version of stage '1,2,3 and 4') is fairly consistent to the stages shown below, though there are some stage 4 cases in T2 and T3.

#A fairly normal distribution. As previously mentioned, there is not much purpose in having a dataset that is consistent in having the same amount of patients in every stage. Visualisations like these confirm that the patients selected to be displayed in the dataset are relatively random and will not cause any nuisance or interferences with further investigation.

#In this plot we have effectively replotted the previous plot with the fill representing cancer stages. This further backs the notion of Stage 2 being the most common cancer within the dataset. The luminal A and B cancers appear to be the most apparent in the dataset, however the cancer stages within each subtype is consistent

#There is a fairly normal distribution of diagnosis age as we can see by the plot. This isn't abnormal, typically the cancer will develop within the 60-70 year old period, with more later age diagnosis than younger, hence the slight right skew.  The overall distribution of cancer types are fairly random, thus age cannot be a good indicator of which cancer stage you will develop. This may be further explored in the modelling of the proteome data. Maybe there is a high amount of specific protein expressions that are more dangerous as age develops. However, just by visualisation, we currently can't make any assumptions.

```

#Checking the subtypes, there still seems to be a certain randomness within the age groups. Hence, age also doesn't indicate what subtype of cancer a patient will develop.

#Although the visualisation is fairly unpleasant, there is further indication that there is no correlation between age and cancer stage nor subtype. Hence, examining the protein expressions will help us understand if there is any relation at the molecular level.

These values are insignificant in comparison to the main four tumor types (luminal, basal-like, her-2), however, they help in understanding that there may be some correlation within the protein expressions of the data.

#Integrated Clusters are another form of classification for breast cancers. I simply checked whether the classifications remain consistent within the subtypes (unsup exp and no exp means supported and unsupported data, in which classifications go up to 5 and 4 respectively and are thus not identical.) Grouping with Integrated by PAM50.RNA indicates consistent subtypes. Basal-Like (top left) is dark, HER2-enriched is still dark except for one point, Luminal A is at stage 3 colour, Luminal B is consistenly bright except for one data point. Overall, the classifications are fairly consistent throughout the data. This is good, no omissions or transformation required.
```

_Having analysed this initial simple dataset, we have found certain trends in the data which may explain some of the results that will be predicted later on. However, there is no mention of protein expressions but rather their cluster expressions and the subtypes that these protein-specific receptors are attached to (ie. some proteins may exist on Luminal A cancers while they are absent on Basal-like cancers). We need an extended dataset, one that may give a better idea of protein expression in which we can implement our predictive modelling._

#We have simply encircled the clustering within each cancer subtypes, their colours can be seen below Through this cluster visualisation, there are clearly similarities within the cancer subtypes regarding which kind of clusters occur within each patient (remembering that we're dealing with mRNA, thus the use of the mRNA and methylation clusters). This visualisation can be compared in the future with principal component analysis of the proteomic expressions (simply a clustering analysis using the actual proteomic values rather than the cluster values).

#This visualisation demonstrates that the significant clusters are also quite consistent, there is a lot of overlapping within the clusters, meaning there could be relationships. These kind of analyses can help in dictating how medication can be described across multiple subtypes considering similar molecular composition. However, Principal Component analysis (PCA) will further analyse this).

_Having written over 600 lines of code and identifying as much as I could, I can now approach the modelling aspect of this project. We should begin with PCA as a segue, but first let's export all datasets within the global environment as CSV files and have them saved in the same directory._


```{r}
write.csv(clinical_data, "clinical_data.csv")
write.csv(proteomes_data, "proteomes_data.csv")
write.csv(proteomes_data_untouched, "proteomes_data_untouched.csv")
write.csv(cancer_data, "cancer_data.csv")
write.csv(cancer_data1, "cancer_data1.csv")
```
