# NPSC2001
NPSC2001 Coding Repository


After having continuously compressed data, the file sizes were too big (over 25mb). Download the entire repository or each individual file and place it in the same directory. Then open Rstudio using the .Proj file. Then open up the markdowns as new separate pages in the RStudio environment. TCGA ANALYSIS covers exploratory analysis, while TCGA ANALYSIS-MODELLING ANALYSIS covers Principal Component analysis and Predictive modelling. Open both .rmd files in the order mentioned. 

The TCGA ANALYSIS file contains data cleaning,wrangling and visualisation techniques. Be sure to follow the steps of loading and installing packages to ensure all visualisations can be seen.

THE TCGA ANALYSIS - MODELLING contains the Principal component analysis and predictive modelling using caret and external packages (visualisations provided with confusion matrix). That should be viewed after the cleaning/visualisation file.
